Each round takes 10 seconds so all players are involved. A game lasts as long as you want it to, 10 minutes is the norm, but playing for 5 minutes is great fun also. BrainBox is educational and is perfect for families and groups of friends to play, wherever they are, on a level-playing field. Packed in a sturdy cool magnetic cube box. BrainBox is ready to play without any set-up time needed. The rules are pretty straight forward. You can play solo or with as many people as you want. A player simply picks a card and studies it for 10 seconds before being asked a question from the back, chosen by the roll of a die. A correct answer means the card is kept, if not it is returned to the box. The player with most cards after 5 or 10 minutes wins! The winner may not be who you expect as this fabulous game is about observation and memory, not learned facts! BrainBox Inventions contains 55 cards with the most amazing and simple inventions. Where would we be without the light bulb, space shuttles. the world wide web or even tea bags?"

The players also have a \"torpedo launcher\" shaped like a submarine which fires discs that glide along the playing surface. The players aim at specific places along the ship waterlines. There, slots allow the discs to slide under the ship and trip a rubber-band mechanism which sends part of the ship's superstructure (or gun turrets) flying, simulating damage."

Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typicially featuring games and commentary by chess masters."

The pieces in the game are cubes that have a circle on one side, a cross on another, and blank faces on the other four; to set up the game, players place the 25 cubes with blanks face-up on the 5x5 grid in the game board. On a turn, the active player takes a cube that is blank or bearing his symbol from the outer ring of the grid, rotates it so that it shows his symbol (if needed), then adds it to the grid by pushing it into one of the rows from which it was removed. Thus, a few pieces of the grid change places each turn, and the cubes slowly go from blank to crosses and circles. Play continues until someone forms an orthogonal or diagonal line of five cubes bearing his symbol, with this person winning the game."

Players (or teams) take turns adding one tile (and only one tile) to the board. Points are scored for correct placement based on the number of the tile laid (placing a \"6\" gets the player 6 points). Points are lost for misplayed tiles (placing a \"6\" incorrectly costs the player 6 points). A misplayed tile is removed from the board. Bonus points are won or lost for correctly/incorrectly completing a row or column (5 points each) or a 3x3 block (15 points) or the whole puzzle (20 points)."
